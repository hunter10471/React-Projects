Users can expect to see download speeds between 100 Mb/s and 200 Mb/s and latency as low as 20ms in most locations.'

        desc:'Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting field in robotics. It\'s certainly the most controversial: Everybody agrees that a robot can work in an assembly line, but there\'s no consensus on whether a robot can ever be intelligent. Like the term "robot" itself, artificial intelligence is hard to define. Ultimate AI would be a recreation of the human thought process â€” a human-made machine with our intellectual abilities. This would include the ability to learn just about anything, the ability to reason, the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas. Roboticists are nowhere near achieving this level of artificial intelligence, but they have made a lot of progress with more limited AI.'

Even today, most data transmission happens via traditional copper cables, which are power-hungry, leading to a compromise between data exchange and energy consumed. Fiber-optic cables are an alternative, but they don\'t work well with the silicon chips in our computing systems.'
